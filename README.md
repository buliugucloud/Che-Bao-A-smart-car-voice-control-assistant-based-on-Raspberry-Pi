# Che-Bao-A-smart-car-voice-control-assistant-based-on-Raspberry-Pi
This is a practical project that is further improved on the basis of the design of the microcomputer interface course-a car voice control assistant named Che Bao. Based on the Raspberry Pi 4B development board, Chebao coordinates the fingerprint, voice interaction, vision, sensor and other modules and GPIO resources, and realizes fingerprint unlocking, fatigue detection, voice interaction opening functions and ensuring driving safety functions (such as automatic light on and There are more than 16 functions such as not wearing seat belt alarm); and through multi-threading technology, different functions can be opened at the same time, which is convenient and more in line with safety regulations.
